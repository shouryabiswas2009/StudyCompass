//                    English, academic fit, what matters most). 0-100.
//   2. QUALITY       "how strong is this school?", only from figures we
//                    actually have (rankings, College Scorecard outcomes).
//   3. PLAUSIBILITY  "can I realistically get in?", from the admission
//                    estimate (or the Reach/Match/Safety rule when there's
//                    no model estimate).

// most to me" (see focusWeights in lib/matching.ts).
//
// There is deliberately NO acceptance-rate factor any more: it gave more
// points to schools that admit almost everyone, which pushed open-admission
// colleges above strong universities. Its 5 points moved to the major (a
// school without your subject isn't an option, however easy to get into).
