# StudyCompass

StudyCompass matches students to universities based on their budget, academic
profile, and preferences instead of showing generic rankings.

Built with Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui,
Supabase (Auth + Database), and Framer Motion.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up Supabase:

   - Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (or use an
     existing one).
   - Open the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard, paste in the contents of
     [`supabase/seed.sql`](supabase/seed.sql), and run it. This creates the
     `profiles`, `universities`, and `saved_universities` tables, sets up Row
     Level Security policies, and seeds ~27 sample universities.
   - Then run [`supabase/migration_002_richer_profiles.sql`](supabase/migration_002_richer_profiles.sql)
     the same way. It upgrades `profiles` to support multiple preferred
     countries/majors and a budget range, and adds a `program_rankings`
     column to `universities` with sample per-subject rankings (illustrative,
     like the rest of the seed data — not real QS subject rankings).
   - Then run [`supabase/migration_003_scores_and_degree_levels.sql`](supabase/migration_003_scores_and_degree_levels.sql).
     It adds an optional SAT score to profiles, database checks that match
     the profile form's validation, and a `degree_levels` column on
     `universities`.
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your project's
     URL and anon/publishable key (Project Settings → API in the dashboard).

3. (Optional, for faster local testing) In your Supabase dashboard, go to
   Authentication → Providers → Email and turn off "Confirm email" so new
   accounts can log in immediately without clicking a confirmation link.
   To turn real confirmation emails on, see
   [Email confirmation](#email-confirmation) below.

4. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Keeping the Supabase project awake

Supabase pauses free-tier projects after about a week with no activity, and
login fails until the project is restored from the dashboard.
[`.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`](.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml) runs
a one-row read query every 3 days to prevent that. It needs two repository
secrets (GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New
repository secret):

- `SUPABASE_URL`: the same value as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: the same value as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

You can run it by hand from the Actions tab ("Keep Supabase awake" → Run
workflow) to check it works. GitHub turns off scheduled workflows in repos
with no commits for 60 days and emails you first; one click re-enables it.

## Email confirmation

Supabase's built-in email sender only delivers to members of your Supabase
team and is limited to a few emails per hour, so confirmation emails to
real users need your own SMTP provider. Gmail works for free without
owning a domain:

1. Turn on 2-Step Verification for your Google account, then create an app
   password at <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>.
2. Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings → enable
   custom SMTP: host `smtp.gmail.com`, port `587`, username = your Gmail
   address, password = the app password, sender email = your Gmail address.
   (If you own a domain, Resend or Brevo also work and look more
   professional; Resend's free plan only sends to your own address until a
   domain is verified.)
3. Authentication → URL Configuration: set Site URL to
   `http://localhost:3000` (your deployed URL later) and add
   `http://localhost:3000/**` to Redirect URLs.
4. Authentication → Emails → Templates → "Confirm signup": change the link to

   ```html
   <a href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email">Confirm your email</a>
   ```

   This sends users to `app/auth/confirm/route.ts`, which verifies the
   token directly, so the link works even when opened on a different device
   than the one used to sign up.
5. Authentication → Providers → Email: turn "Confirm email" back on.

## How matching works

`lib/matching.ts` scores each university 0–100 based on three factors versus
the student's profile: whether tuition fits their budget (up to 50 points),
whether the university is in one of their preferred countries (25 points),
and whether it offers one of their intended majors (25 points). The
explanation shown alongside each score is generated from the same factors
with plain string templates — no external AI API is called, so there's no
added cost or latency.

Two rules sit on top of the score:

- **Degree level is a hard requirement.** A school that doesn't offer the
  student's degree level scores 0 and is left out of recommendations. An
  empty `degree_levels` list means "unknown", so the school isn't ruled out.
- **`budget_min` adds information, not a penalty.** If tuition is below half
  the student's minimum budget, the explanation calls it "much cheaper than
  your range" and suggests checking what the fee covers. It doesn't lower
  the score, because paying less isn't a worse fit.

`getDisplayRanking()` shows the QS ranking for the specific program that
matched the student's major when we have that data (`program_rankings` on
the university), and falls back to the university-wide ranking labeled
"Overall" otherwise — so a ranking is never shown without saying what it's
actually ranking.

## Notes

- Row Level Security is enabled on all tables — profiles and saved
  universities are only readable/writable by their owner; the universities
  table is public read-only.
- Auth uses `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions shared between the
  browser, Server Components, and Server Actions.
