            {BRAND_NAME} is a free, non-commercial project. It stores only what it needs to match you
            with universities, only you can see your data, nothing is sold or shared, there are no ads,
            and you can delete everything at any time.

          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1.5">
            <li>Your email address and password. Logins are handled by Supabase Auth; the password is stored only as a secure hash, and {BRAND_NAME} never sees it.</li>
            <li>Your profile: name, country, intended majors, grades and test scores you enter, budget, preferred countries and degree level, and what matters most to you.</li>
            <li>Universities you save, applications and offers you track (status, deadlines, costs, scholarships, notes, accept-by dates), and any universities you add yourself.</li>

        <Section title="If you use the site without an account">
          <p>
            The &ldquo;Try it&rdquo; quiz on the home page sends your three answers to the server
            once to work out your matches. They aren&apos;t saved anywhere. University pages can be
            read without an account; nothing about you is stored.

        <Section title="Who can see it">
          <p>
            Only you. The database checks every request against your login (row-level security), so
            other users can&apos;t read your profile, saved schools, applications or the universities
            you added. Your data isn&apos;t sold, rented or shared with anyone, and isn&apos;t used for
            advertising.

          <p>
            Vercel Web Analytics counts page views so we can see which pages are used. It doesn&apos;t
            use cookies; visitors are told apart only by a hash of the request that&apos;s discarded
            after 24 hours. It records the page address, the referring site, an approximate location
            (country, region, city), browser, operating system and device type, and only shows totals.

          <p>
            Go to <Link href="/profile" className="font-medium text-primary underline">your profile</Link> and
            choose &ldquo;Delete my account and data&rdquo;. It permanently deletes your login and
            everything listed above, straight away. You can also change or clear any profile answer at any
            time.

            ask anyone to delete your data: you can do it yourself at any time (see above).
